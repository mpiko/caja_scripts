This work is based on someone elses and as soon a I recall who it was, I will note their great work here.

These scripts add a context menu (right click menu) to caja.
- Right clicking a file or folder
- Select the **scripts** option and choose the action
- A file selector will open

These scripts reside in $HOME/.config/caja/scripts


Ensure they are executable 
```
chmod 755 $HOME/.config/caja/scripts/*
```
